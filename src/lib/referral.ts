/**
 * Referral attribution for the branding links (ADR-027).
 *
 * The project is a GitHub template: people clone it and deploy their own page. Every
 * clone's masthead/footer links back to the maker's repo and support page, so those
 * links are how the maker measures template adoption — without any backend.
 *
 * `withReferral` tags an outbound link so a click is traceable to the *source
 * project* and the specific clone. `readInboundSource` reads where a visit was
 * referred from, for a quiet on-page reference. Both take an injectable argument so
 * they stay pure and unit-testable.
 *
 * No network call happens here — `withReferral` only builds an href, so hard rule 4
 * (nothing over the wire when analytics is off) holds. Capturing these signals in
 * PostHog is Session 5 (analytics); this file only builds and reads URLs.
